DISCO:
* Statments like "127.0.0.1 - - [07/Oct/2024 11:37:44] "GET /auth HTTP/1.1" 200" show what paths were accessed
* Any username produces the same output
* When testmod0.py is imported it's name is not main. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* Why does testmod0.py also run when it is only imported and a flask object was not created in it
* Does importing testmod0.py create a separate flask object?
*
